# 🧠 EEG-Based Object Recognition  

This project investigates the use of **machine learning models** to classify whether a person is looking at a **natural** or **artificial** object based on EEG data.  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
- **Dataset:** OpenNeuro EEG dataset [ds003825](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003825/versions/1.2.0)  
- **Models Used:**
  - **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
  - **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**
  - **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
- **Best Performance:** All models achieved ~66% accuracy
